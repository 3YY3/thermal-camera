# `thermal-camera`

Firmware for my hand-rolled LWIR camera, based on ESP32 and FLIR Lepton 3.

The thermal camera driver is mostly ported from my previous [leptonic](https://github.com/themainframe/leptonic) code.

For (much) more information, see my blog post on [damow.net](https://damow.net/building-a-thermal-camera).
